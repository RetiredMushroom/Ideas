everything is made of smaller 'building blocks'.
universe- superclusters- galaxies- planetary systems-
singular cosmic bodies(stars, planets)- ecosystems(not sure)- 
individual beings- cells- atoms and molecules- protons, neutrons, electrons-
quarks- etc.

maybe proved by:
1) seeing a similarity or pattern between the building blocks and the one above them 
in terms of size, function, etc. ratio between the size of two building blocks.
2) seeing if the changes in the building blocks below(a few levels below) a certain building block
affects the building block(certain) or the building blocks above it.
3) to find the values of certain measurements in one BB(building block) level with extreme accuracy
and precision( may not be possible), and see if theres any variation. if there is variatio  this 
could be the lower BB levels causing this.

could mean the universe we live in could be the building blocks to another system of
building blocks which in turn continue to be bigger and bigger. the same can be 
applied downwards. which means no matter how hard we try we cant find the single most
smallest particle. so for the prediction of the behaviour of BBs(building blocks) you have
to find a balance between the insignificance of the building block you want to take into 
consideration is and the size of the BB in a way that enough precision is acquired.
this could be what were doing now.---1
